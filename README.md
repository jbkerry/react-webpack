# React Webpack Project

A simple setup for a React project utilising Webpack as a builder.

The motivation for this repo was to see if I could manually create a project template that contained all the features I
commonly use from [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), in the simplest possible way.

**Comes bundled with:**

- react and react-dom
- jest
- pre-commit check:
  - prettier
  - eslint (airbnb, react/recommended)
- webpack loaders:
  - babel for es6+ & jsx
  - sass support
  - eslint

See specific config files for more details.
